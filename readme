1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have these installed:
Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) → Install here
Docker (you already have)

gcloud auth login
gcloud auth configure-docker

gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID

2. Tag Your Local Docker Image
docker tag my-app gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/my-app

3. Push to Google Container Registry (GCR)
docker push gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/my-app

4. Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy my-app --image gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/my-app --platform managed --region europe-west1 --allow-unauthenticated

5. Check Deployment
Once done, you’ll see a URL like:
Service [my-app] revision [my-app-00001] has been deployed and is serving 100 percent of traffic at https://my-app-xxxxx.a.run.app
